<dd><ul>If you are aged between 18 and 60, you can donate blood, irrespective of your gender.
<li>Your body should not weigh less than 45 kg.</li>
<li>Your haemoglobin level should be normal – that is, 12.5 gm/cent.</li>
<li>Blood pressure  must be under check. If you are not aware of your blood pressure, don’t worry. At the camps they quickly check whether the blood pressure is at the aceptable level.</li>
<li>If you even have the slightest doubt that you are infected by Hepatitis, HIV, AIDS or any other venereal disease, you should not donate blood.</li>
<li>If you have suffered from diarrhea, jaundice, malaria, dengue, donate blood after a gap of six months, only when you completely recover.</li>
<li>If you have swollen glands, persistent coughs, transfused blood or have had a any major surgery or dental extraction, you need to take doctor’s advice before donating blood.</li>
<li>If you have tattoos imprinted recently, or have used drugs like cocaine and ganja (drugs that are prohibited by Indian Law) doctors recommend you to take a gap of six months. This is because, if the needles / syringes used are not clean enough, you have the chances of contracting HIV which would be detected only after a few months.</li>
<li>If you have been vaccinated for Cholera, Typhoid, Diptheria, Tetanus or plague or taken a Gamma Globulin shot within last 15 days, you should not donate blood.</li>
<li>An interval of a year is recommended in case you have undergone a major or minor surgery, or you or your close relatives have suffered from typhoid, jaundice, chickangunya fever, rabies vaccine or hepatitis.</li>
<li>If it has been five years since your recovery from cancer and have completed your treatment, then you can donate blood provided you show you are medically fit.</li></dd>
